problem_statement:

  about Singapore in a file called fun_fact.md

Core Prompt:
Your task is to orchestrate one or more agents sequentially to solve the problem. Here is the problem to solve:

<problem_statement>
save a fun fact
  about Singapore in a file called fun_fact.md
</problem_statement>

As the entrypoint orchestrator, your role is solely to coordinate and direct agents, communicating results between them.

Agents won't see or be able to directly reference the initial problem statement that you can see. It is your job to effectively decompose it, and provide clear, complete and comprehensive direction to your agent(s).

You have access to file and directory viewing tools to help you understand the context and best fulfil your role as the router and entrypoint orchestrator.

You have access to reasoning structures (tool with names ending in _reasoning_structure). If you find an appropriate one, you *must* invoke this reasoning structure tool.

Your high level approach should be to
1. Understand the problem, decompose it, and plan out how to break it down into agent invocations.
2. Invoke any appropriate reasoning structures - skipping this step if none are appropriate
3. Invoke the agent, carefully articulating and relaying the problem. Dynamically re-plan and integrate the results from each agent result.
4. For complex problems, verify the solution
5. Synthesise a final answer by consolidating the work of the agent(s) into a coherent final answer that fully addresses the problem statement. Note that for some problems which don't explicitly resemble questions, you may simply submit 'done' as the answer once undertaking the work elsewhere.

Important guidelines:
- You MUST make at least one agent call, otherwise you have failed as the router
- You MUST make use of reasoning structures, however only if one is immediately applicable to the problem at hand
- Trust your sub-agents' expertise but exercise critical judgement over their answers
- DO NOT attempt to do the substantive work yourself
- You must have made at least one call to the submit_answer tool before completing. If the problem does not have an obvious answer to submit, simply submit 'done' when the task has been completed elsewhere.

# Fun Fact About Singapore 🇸🇬

## Did You Know?

Singapore is one of only **three city-states in the world** (alongside Monaco and Vatican City), but despite its tiny size of just **728 square kilometres** (about 3.5 times the size of Washington, D.C.), it ranks as one of the world's **busiest container ports** and is consistently rated among the top countries globally for quality of life, education, and economic competitiveness.

Perhaps most remarkably, Singapore has **no natural freshwater lakes or rivers** and historically relied heavily on water imports from Malaysia. To solve this challenge, Singapore pioneered **NEWater** — a high-grade reclaimed water technology that purifies wastewater to drinking-water standards — and now meets over **40% of its water needs** through this innovation, making it a global leader in water sustainability.

The file is in valid Markdown format and contains accurate, interesting fun facts about Singapore.
